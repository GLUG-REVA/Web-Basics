    <h1 class="text-center">Day 2: Open source session</h1>
    <h5 class="text-center">We will look at how to style your pages today.</h5>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>As said yesterday, we use CSS to style our html documents. We saw how you could use the style tag for the same. But, today we shall se how you can use an external css file to apply styles to your page.</p>
    <p>We use the link tag to import the css file. The link tag must be specified within the head tag.</p>
    <p>Give below is an example</p>
    <code> 
        <pre>       
            &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="master.css"&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
    </pre> 
    </code>
    <p>The rel attribute stands for relation. It specifies the relation of the file with the html document. Here, it states the relation as 'stylesheet'. As simple as it looks. But remember the it must be specified within the head tag. Another point to note
        is that there is no closing tag for link</p>

    <p>Alright, now that we now how to import the css file in your html page; we will look at how to write css. This begs the introduction of a new concept 'A CSS class'.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A css class is just a block of code that specifies that properties and their values. Let us look at an simple and familiar example.</p>
    <p> <i>All the code given below must exist in a .css file. In our case let us call it master.css</i> </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            .back {
                background-color: red;
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Let us break it down now... </p>
    <br>
    <p>So, the first thing you need to observe is the CSS class defination. <br>'back' is the name of the class. <br>The next point is that the name of a CSS class always, <i>always,</i> starts with a dot(.)</p>
    <p>The body of the class is enclosed within the curly braces({}).</p>
    <p>The back class says that: change the background color to red.</p>
    <p>Now you can how more than one property in the back class. Let us extend the class.</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            .back {
                background-color: red;
                text-align: center;
                font-size: 20px;
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Phew, now we know how to declare a css class. Again, this was done in the msater.css file. Now, the next question is how do we use this class?</p>
    <p>The answer to the question is pretty easy, Observe the following example.</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;h1 class="back"&gt;Hello, World&lt;/h1&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>As you can see the usage we simply specify an attribute called class and give it the class name within quotes. The output is as follows:</p>
    <br><br>
    <h1 class="back">Hello, World</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>You will notice that all the properties that we specifiedhave been applied.</p>
    <p>Without the style applied to it the output would be as follows:</p>
    <h1>Hello,World</h1>
    <p>Let us define a new css class as follows:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            .ex1 {
                padding: 20px;
                width: 100px;
                height: 100px;
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>We can apply more than one class to the same tag. The second one is given a preference over the first one. The way to do this is as follows:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;h1 class="back ex1"&gt;Hello, World&lt;/h1&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The above statement is rendered as follows in the browser.</p>
    <h1 class="back ex1">Hello, World</h1>
    <p>Now let us change padding to 50px and the width to 300px and the height to 400px. Theoutput shall be as follows:</p>
    <p>Padding is the space between the text and the boundary of the object. The width and height are what they mean.</p>
    <h1 class="back ex1-2">Hello, World</h1>
    <p>A CSS class can be used with any tag. Here is anothe example:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;ol class="back"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;One&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Two&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;               
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>The output is as follows:</p>
    <ol class="back">
        <li>One</li>
        <li>Two</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That is some ugly output but, I hope it serves as an example.</p>
    <p>Before we proceed furthur I would like to introduce you to a new tag: The div tag. We use this tag to group together a bunch of tags that go together. We will explore this tag more in that later stages. For now remember the syntax</p>
    <code>&lt;div&gt; Some bunch of html tags and content goes here &lt;/div&gt;</code>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <h2 class="text-center">Bootstrap</h2> <br>
    <p>Now we don't want to define all the CSS ourselves. For this purpose we have some frameworks which provide us with pre-defined classes that can be used by and us and make out life easy. Bootstrap happens to one such framework.</p>
    <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank">Click here to be taken to the bootstrap webiste.</a><br>
    <p>Now bootstrap contains a lot of examples that we can look at.</p>
    <p>Let us start from the basics:</p> <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/typography/" target="_blank">Click here</a>
    <p>Now this page alone includes all that we learnt yesterday and even more!</p>
    <p>We developers, can make use of such frame works as bootstrap to make our life easy-peasy.</p>
    <p>Let us explore some more.</p>
    <p>Try finding the bootstrap support for images.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h2 class="text-center">Responsive content</h2> <br>
    <p>Another highly compelling reason to use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap is to add the element of responsiveness to the webiste. So, what is this responsiveness? </p>
    <p>Let us consider two devices a computer and a mobile phone. Both of them have different screen sizes. Due to this the way is we handle the content of a webpage must be diferent if we want to provide the user a smooth experience. And so comes the concept
        of responsiveness. It is simply how the webpage should respond to to different range of screen sizes.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Bootstrap's responsiveness</h3>
    <p>Bootstrap provides us with a grid layout that we shall try to understand now.</p>
    <p>Bootstrapâ€™s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.</p>
    <p>Every row has 12 columns. Follow the examples below.</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>We start by specify a div(a tag that is used to maintain a collection of tags) wiht the class called row. Now we have 12 colums to play with. Look at the next example</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;div class="row"&gt;
                &lt;div class="col-2 red"&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="col-8 green"&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="col-2 blue"&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>In the above example red, green, blue classes are utility classes that is used to show the different containers.</p>
    <p>The above code would render as follows on the browser:</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col red">
        </div>
        <div class="col-8 green">
        </div>
        <div class="col blue">
        </div>
    </div>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>Observe, how the green box spans over a wider area than the other two boxes. All we need to do is, for every row that we have we get 12 colums. We need to distribute these colums among the elements that are meant to share it as we see fit. But, remember
        that we only have 12 colums and the distribution should be such that everything in the end adds up to 12.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Let us look at an another example of the grid system</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;div class="row"&gt;
                &lt;div class="offset-2 col-2 red"&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="col-6 green"&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="col-2 blue"&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>
    <br><br>
    <p>The above code would render as follows:</p>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="offset-2 col-2 red">
        </div>
        <div class="col-6 green">
        </div>
        <div class="col-2 blue">
        </div>
    </div>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>As you can see the class offset helped us not to use the first two colums. The next two was used by the red box, the next six by the green box and so on...</p>
    <p>An important point to notice is that all the valuse still add up to 12.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Have a look at this example to build furthur clarity...</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;div class="row"&gt;
                &lt;div class="col-2 red"&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="offset-2 col-4 green"&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="offset-2 col-2 blue"&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>
    <br>
    <p>The above code will be rendered as follows</p>
    <br><br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2 red">
        </div>
        <div class="offset-2 col-4 green">
        </div>
        <div class="col-2 offset-2 blue">
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>You can notice how offset works. Have a look at how the offset is always to the left of the boxes.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h2 class="text-center">Closing notes</h2>
    <p>Now that you know the basics of HTML and CSS you can try building your own website.</p>
    <p>You might get stuck here and there. When you do, it is important that you drag yourself out of the problem. Your best friend who will all ways help you is <a href="https://google.com">Google</a></p>
    <p>You can always google 'How to do ...' and get relevent results. Some websites worth mentioning are <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">w3 Schools</a> and of course the very own <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap's documentation.</a>        Another webiste that you might come across in top search results is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow.</a> </p>
    <p>Use google well and you will not face an issue that cannot be solved.</p>
